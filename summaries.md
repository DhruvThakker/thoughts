### Poor Charlie's Almanac
##### Quotes
```
Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up. 
Discharge your duties faithfully and well. Systematically you get ahead 
but not necessarily in fast spurts. Nevertheless you build discipline 
by preparing by preparing for fast spurts. Slug it out day by day one inch at a time. 
At the end of the dady if you live long enough you get what you deserve.

### Java:Concurrency in Practice

- Final, synchonized volatile keywords
- Thread safe objects, object sharing. 
- Java memory model. Out of order execution as-if semantics. compiler optimization

##### Excerpts 
```
When a field is declared volatile, the compiler and runtime are put on notice 
that this variable is shared and that operations on it should not be reordered 
with other memory operations. Volatile variables are not cached in registers 
or in caches where they are hidden from other processors, so a read of a volatile 
variable always returns the most recent write by any thread.

Synchronization also has another significant, and subtle, aspect: memory visibility. 
In the absence of synchronization, the compiler, processor, and runtime can do some 
downright weird things to the order in which operations appear to execute. Attempts 
to reason about the order in which memory actions “must” happen in insufflciently 
synchronized multithreaded programs will almost certainly be incorrect.

### Theory of Nearly Everything

##### Quotes
``` 
Welcome. And congratulations. I am delighted that you could make it. 
Getting here wasn't easy, I know. In fact, I suspect it was a little tougher than you realize.
To begin with, for you to be here now trillions of drifting atoms had somehow to assemble in 
an intricate and intriguingly obliging manner to create you. It's an arrangement so specialized 
and particular that it has never been tried before and will only exist this once. For the next many years (we hope) 
these tiny particles will uncomplainingly engage in all the billions of deft, cooperative efforts 
necessary to keep you intact and let you experience the supremely agreeable but generally underappreciated 
state known as existence.
